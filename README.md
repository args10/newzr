# Newzr.
A lightweight, user-friendly application for local news.

## Prerequisites

VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Live Server Plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer 

## Installation
In principle you can use service like node or http to run this app. The app does not have a "backend" yet and all of the code (including fetching data from newsapi) is written in the frontend. For the sake of simplicity 

## Usage

Open http://localhost:5500/ in a modern (such as https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser.
